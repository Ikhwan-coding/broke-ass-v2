Progress log - April 7th 2020

-- Figured out with the help of a flow diagram what my "create tranaction" needs to look like 
-- Essentially : 

1. Create transaction

2a. Create Details
2a. Create Fees 

3a. Create Txn Detail Tags
3a. Create Txn Detail Categories
3a. Create Txn Detail SubCategories

Next steps :
-- Create the connecting tables that resolves the m-m's
----- Dont really know how to do that yet so figure that out. 

-- Create the details table
-- Create the fee table
-- Create the txn table
-- Create the txn Transaction that executes creating a single transaction. 

-- Add Endpoints for " Update "
